# JUnit 4 to JUnit 5
It's almost pretty sure you heard about JUnit 5 but maybe you have never migrated to it because you already use JUnit 4 and it does the work with it :)

You're right but if you have read what is new with JUnit 5, you would certainly migrate right now.

This kata is done for this. It's based on :
* JUnit 4 tests and assertions
* JUnit 4 parameterized tests
* AssertJ assertions

And the project is about the tarot game :)

## Goal of this kata
The goal of this kata is to migrate to JUnit 5.

You will see after :
* if you need to use junit-vintage
* if it's better to use AssertJ assertions or easy to migrate JUnit 4 assertions
* how the parameterized tests work with Junit 5
* the grouped assertions
* the new annotations
* ...

A very useful link about JUnit 5 in french : http://www.jmdoudoux.fr/java/dej/chap-junit5.htm

You will find on this branch a proposal of what can be done with JUnit 5 and its most used features.
