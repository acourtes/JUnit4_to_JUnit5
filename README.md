# JUnit 4 to JUnit 5
It's almost pretty sure you heard about JUnit 5 but maybe you have never migrated to it because you already use JUnit 4 and it does the work with it :)

You're right but if you have read what is new with JUnit 5, you would certainly migrate right now.

This kata is done for this. It's based on :
* JUnit 4 tests and assertions
* AssertJ assertions

And the project is about the tarot game :)
